# Machine Learning @ the Extreme Edge

<div style="text-align: justify">
  <p>Today's challenge is real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge using Artificial Intelligence. However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. Today's challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices.

  <p>Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) looks at how we can apply machine learning in the development of accurate, energy-efficient, and intelligent (wireless) (battery-powered) devices. The primary focus lies on the machine learning part - the design of a regression model - using the case study as the backbone. We will follow a machine-learning workflow, using open-source software (e.g. Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras) and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks <a href="https://www.edgeimpulse.com/">Edge Impulse Studio</a> and <a href="https://wandb.ai/">Weights and Biases</a>. Because of the limited time, the intelligent device's development is outside this project's scope.</p>

    <p>During the project, additional IMU data is collected in a gait laboratory - a written request to a Medical Ethics Committee is submitted and approved - to investigate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and Out-of-Distribution examples. We also briefly touch on uncertainty (aleatoric and epistemic) and model explainability.</p>

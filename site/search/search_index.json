However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. Today's challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices. Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) examines applying embedded machine learning to develop accurate, energy-efficient models for these intelligent resource-constrained devices.</p> <p> The Embedded Machine Learning Workflow (to enlarge, click on the image). Because of the limited time, the intelligent device's development is outside this project's scope.</p> <p>In the project, an embedded machine-learning workflow is developed, using open-source software (e.g. Python, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/Keras) in combination with MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks Edge Impulse Studio and Weights and Biases . Besides, a case study is workout and a embedded machine learning model is developed.</p>"},{"location":"#case-study-gait-stride-length-estimation","title":"Case Study: Gait Stride Length Estimation.","text":"<p> \"This image was created with the assistance of DALL\u00b7E 2.\"</p> <p>Spatiotemporal gait parameters, e.g., gait stride length, are some measurements derived from gait analysis. Today, different solutions are available for gait assessment outside the laboratory, specifically for spatiotemporal gait parameters. Such solutions are wearable devices that comprise an inertial measurement unit, IMU and a microcontroller, MCU. However, these existing wearable devices are resource constrained. They contain a processing unit with limited processing and memory capabilities, which limit the use of machine learning to estimate spatiotemporal gait parameters directly on the device. The solution is embedded machine learning or tiny machine learning (tinyML\u2122). Starting from the  TRIPOD dataset, a regression model is developed for estimating the gait stride length. We explore if the model can be deployed on a resource-constrained device.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"supervisory_group/","title":"Supervisory Group","text":"<p> \"This image was created with the assistance of DALL\u00b7E 2.\"     </p> <p>Researcher: Joeri Verbiest, PhD MSc</p> The members <ul> <li>Zorginstelling Heder, Antwerp, Belgium.</li> <li>Centre for Health and Technology, University of Antwerp, Belgium</li> <li>Capetech BVBA, Leuven, Belgium</li> <li>Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, Rehabilitation Research Group (Reval), Hasselt University, Belgium</li> <li>Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy Research group MOVANT, University of Antwerp, Belgium</li> <li>Edge Impulse Inc.

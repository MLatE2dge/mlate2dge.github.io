However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. Today's challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices.   </p> <p> The Embedded Machine Learning Workflow (to enlarge, click on the image).</p> <p>Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) looks at how we can apply machine learning in the development of accurate, energy-efficient, and intelligent (wireless) (battery-powered) devices. In the project, we mainly focus on the machine learning part. The primary focus lies on the design of a regression model, using the case study as the backbone. We will follow a machine-learning workflow, using open-source software (e.g. Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras) and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks Edge Impulse Studio and Weights and Biases. The development of the intelligent device is outside the scope of this project.</p> <p>During the project, additional IMU data is collected in a gait laboratory - a written request to a Medical Ethics Committee is submitted and approved - to investigate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and Out-of-Distribution examples. We also briefly touch on uncertainty (aleatoric and Epistemic) and model explainability (e.g. Shap: SHapley Additive exPlanations).</p>  To get to know more, contact: \ud83c\udf10 J. R.

Today, different solutions are available for gait assessment outside the laboratory, specifically for spatiotemporal gait parameters. Such solutions are wearable devices that comprise an inertial measurement unit, IMU and a microcontroller, MCU. However, these existing wearable devices are resource constrained. They contain a processing unit with limited processing and memory capabilities, which limit the use of machine learning to estimate spatiotemporal gait parameters directly on the device. The solution is embedded machine learning or tiny machine learning (tinyML\u2122). Starting from the  TRIPOD dataset, a regression model is developed for estimating the gait stride length. This model can be deployed on a wearable with an MCU and an IMU sensor.</p>  The research results will be published in an Open-Access scientific publication (in preparation).  <p></p>"},{"location":"supervisory_group/","title":"Supervisory Group","text":"<p> \"This image was created with the assistance of DALL\u00b7E 2.\"     </p> The members      <ul> <li>Zorginstelling Heder, Antwerp, Belgium.</li> <li>Centre for Health and Technology, University of Antwerp, Belgium</li> <li>Capetech BVBA, Leuven, Belgium</li> <li>Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, Rehabilitation Research Group (Reval), Hasselt University, Belgium</li> <li>Department of Rehabilitation Sciences and Physiotherapy Research group MOVANT, University of Antwerp, Belgium</li> <li>Edge Impulse Inc.

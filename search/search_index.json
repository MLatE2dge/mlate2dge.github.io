Spatiotemporal gait parameters, e.g., gait stride length, are some measurements derived from gait analysis. Today, different solutions are available for gait assessment outside the laboratory, specifically for spatiotemporal gait parameters. Such solutions are wearable devices that comprise an inertial measurement unit, IMU and a microcontroller, MCU. However, these existing wearable devices are resource constrained. They contain a processing unit with limited processing and memory capabilities, which limit the use of machine learning to estimate spatiotemporal gait parameters directly on the device. The solution is embedded machine learning or tiny machine learning (tinyML\u2122). The Embedded Machine Learning Workflow - is under development (to enlarge, click on the image). The project uses open-source software and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks Edge Impulse Studio and Weights and Biases . The development of the smart device is outside the scope of the project. Starting from the TRIPOD dataset and embedded machine learning, a regression model is developed for estimating the gait stride length. This model can be deployed on a wearable with an MCU and an IMU sensor. Besides, additional IMU data is collected in a gait laboratory - a written request to a Medical Ethics Committee is submitted and approved - to investigate the model's ability to adapt appropriately to unseen data. Finally, strategies are formulated to improve the machine learning model design and embedded machine learning workflow.

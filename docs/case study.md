<div style="text-align: justify">
  <p>Spatiotemporal gait parameters, e.g., gait stride length, are some measurements derived from gait analysis. Today, different solutions are available for gait assessment outside the laboratory, specifically for spatiotemporal gait parameters. Such solutions are wearable devices that comprise an inertial measurement unit, IMU and a microcontroller, MCU. However, these existing wearable devices are resource constrained. They contain a processing unit with limited processing and memory capabilities, which limit the use of machine learning to estimate spatiotemporal gait parameters directly on the device. The solution is embedded machine learning or tiny machine learning (tinyML™). Starting from the <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/6/9/95"> TRIPOD dataset</a>, a regression model is developed for estimating the gait stride length. This model can be deployed on a wearable with an MCU and an IMU sensor. Besides, Additional IMU data is collected in a gait laboratory - a written request to a Medical Ethics Committee is submitted and approved - to investigate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. </p>

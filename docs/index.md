# Machine Learning @ the Extreme Edge

<div style="text-align: justify">
  <p>Today's challenge is real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge using Artificial Intelligence. However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. Today's challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices.

  <p>Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) examines how to apply machine learning to develop accurate, energy-efficient, intelligent devices. The primary focus lies on the machine learning part, the design of a regression model, given a healthcare case study as the backbone. We will follow a machine-learning workflow, using open-source software (e.g. Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras) and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks <a href="https://www.edgeimpulse.com/">Edge Impulse Studio</a> and <a href="https://wandb.ai/">Weights and Biases</a>. Because of the limited time, the intelligent device's development is outside this project's scope.</p>

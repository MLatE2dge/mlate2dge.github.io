However, a recent trend exists to implement machine learning on devices located on the extreme edge, i.e. the border between the analog (physical) and digital world. These devices consist of one or more sensors and a resource-constrained embedded device, i.e. a device with limited memory, computing power, and power consumption. Today's challenge is the development of accurate, energy-efficient machine learning models for deployment on these resource-constrained devices. The Embedded Machine Learning Workflow (to enlarge, click on the image). Machine Learning at the Extreme Edge (ML@E2dge) examines how to apply machine learning to develop accurate, energy-efficient, intelligent devices. The primary focus lies on the machine learning part - the design of a regression model - given a healthcare application as the backbone. We will follow a machine-learning workflow, using open-source software (e.g. Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras) and MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) frameworks Edge Impulse Studio and Weights and Biases . Because of the limited time, the intelligent device's development is outside this project's scope. To get to know more, contact: \ud83c\udf10 J. R. Verbiest, PhD MSc Project supported by the Karel de Grote University of Applied Sciences and Arts through funding by the Flemish government specifically allocated to practice-based research at universities of applied sciences. Project duration: 1 December 2021 - 31 August 2023 (14 person-month).","title":"Home"},{"location":"#machine-learning-the-extreme-edge","text":"Today's challenge is real-time and energy-efficient information extraction and processing at the edge using Artificial Intelligence.

Spatiotemporal gait parameters, e.g., gait stride length, are some measurements derived from gait analysis. Today, different solutions are available for gait assessment outside the laboratory, specifically for spatiotemporal gait parameters. Such solutions are wearable devices that comprise an inertial measurement unit, IMU and a microcontroller, MCU. However, these existing wearable devices are resource constrained. They contain a processing unit with limited processing and memory capabilities, which limit the use of machine learning to estimate spatiotemporal gait parameters directly on the device. The solution is embedded machine learning or tiny machine learning (tinyML\u2122). Starting from the TRIPOD dataset , a regression model is developed for estimating the gait stride length. This model can be deployed on a wearable with an MCU and an IMU sensor. Besides, Additional IMU data is collected in a gait laboratory - a written request to a Medical Ethics Committee is submitted and approved - to investigate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.","title":"Case Study"},{"location":"case%20study/#case-study","text":"\"This image was created with the assistance of DALL\u00b7E 2.\"","title":"Case Study"},{"location":"supervisory_group/","text":"Supervisory Group \"This image was created with the assistance of DALL\u00b7E 2.\" The members Zorginstelling Heder, Antwerp, Belgium.
